# 🧙‍♂️ Hogwarts Sorting Hat Quiz (Python)

Ever wondered which Hogwarts house you'd be sorted into?  
This is a command-line Python quiz that uses your answers to personality-driven questions to assign you to:

- 🦁 Gryffindor  
- 🐍 Slytherin  
- 🦅 Ravenclaw  
- 🦡 Hufflepuff

But be careful — one wrong answer, and the Sorting Hat might just expel you. 🪄

## 🎮 How It Works

You'll be asked 7 questions, each with 4 options:
- Traits you value
- How you solve problems
- Career & subject choices
- Reactions to failure

Each answer increases the score of a matching house. At the end, the house with the highest score is revealed as your true Hogwarts home.

Invalid input? The Sorting Hat gets angry... and ends the quiz early.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the script:

```
python sorting_hat.py
````

## 🧰 What You'll Learn

* Handling user input (`input()` and `int()`)
* Using conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
* Tracking scores with variables and dictionaries
* Using `max()` to find the winning house

## 💡 Example Output
